# Sensors-App-GUI
Creating Sensor Data Application

The application's main purpose is to visualize readings from sensors which I have in the office. There are temperature, 
humidity, co2, PM2.5 and PM10 sensors and all of them are working wireless. Each of them is part of MESH network and there is also one gate which gathers all the readings, 
then sends it via Ethernet to Linux server for which I have API, so I can read them in my GUI by using GET method. I also perform some logical checks on the data gathered from 
sensors and user can see trends for each value. The application is still in build, so every follow up would be nice.

Kind Regards, 
Mateusz.
